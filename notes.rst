TO DO:
* check for keys and datatypes in response
* schema validation
* pytest exceptions - pytest raises

TO READ:
* pytest parametrize

TO CLARIFY:


-- notes --
* validate what came from API - routes level
* api serializers - validation (one/two files - what comes in and comes out) - try with pydantic

use pydantic objects ONLY to validate and serialize to inner model - models.py

pytest parametrize (parametrized test) - similar to scenario outline from cucumber - try to use

add negative paths for tests - ie. string in id
